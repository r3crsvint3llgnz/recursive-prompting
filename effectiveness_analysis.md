# Effectiveness Analysis and Success Factors

## My Effectiveness Analysis and Success Factors

In this section, I share the factors that I personally found most important in making recursive prompting effective for me. These are based on my own sessions and self-assessment from 441 conversations (1,980 moves across 13 move types), not controlled studies. They should be read as observations from my n=1 exploratory practice and hypotheses that others may want to test in their own work.

### Success Factors I Noticed

**Disclaimer:** These success factors reflect my personal experience only and may not apply to other practitioners or contexts.

#### 1. Strategic Move Selection
I found that effectiveness depended a lot on choosing the right move for the situation:

- Task Complexity: When problems felt complicated, decomposition and systematic approaches helped me make progress
- Domain Characteristics: In technical tasks, testing and validation moves were more useful. In creative tasks, probing and exploration moves worked better
- Goal Clarity: When my goals were clear, refinement strategies were easier to apply. When they weren't, probing or metacognitive reflection helped me clarify them
- Time Constraints: When I was short on time, efficient patterns worked better than broad exploration

#### 2. Adaptive Sequencing
I often needed to adjust the sequence of moves as conversations unfolded:

- Recognizing Opportunities: I became better at spotting when a familiar pattern could apply
- Modifying Sequences: I would adapt standard patterns depending on the AI's response
- Switching Patterns: Sometimes I had to pivot midstream, shifting from exploration into refinement
- Combining Patterns: For complex problems, I blended elements from multiple patterns rather than sticking to one

#### 3. Metacognitive Awareness
I noticed that being explicitly reflective during sessions paid off:

- Regular Reflection: Pausing to check whether I was still on track helped me avoid wasted cycles
- Assumption Checking: Asking myself "what am I assuming here?" often changed the direction of the session for the better
- Goal Monitoring: Keeping the original goal in mind prevented me from drifting too far off course
- Strategy Evaluation: Reflecting on which moves worked and which didn't made future sessions smoother

### Failure Modes I Experienced

**Disclaimer:** These failure modes reflect my personal experience and may not represent common failure patterns for other practitioners.

Not every conversation went smoothly. Here are failure patterns I personally ran into, and what helped me address them:

- Pattern Mismatch: Sometimes I applied the wrong pattern to the wrong situation. It reminded me to step back and reflect before forcing a structure
- Premature Convergence: I often tried to settle on a solution too quickly. I learned to deliberately include exploration phases before locking in
- Metacognitive Neglect: When I forgot to reflect, I tended to wander or repeat myself. Adding explicit reflection prompts fixed this
- Context Loss: In long conversations, I sometimes lost track of the original goal. Regularly restating goals and progress summaries helped me stay grounded

### Optimization Strategies That Helped Me

**Disclaimer:** These optimization strategies worked for my specific practice and context. Their effectiveness may vary for other practitioners.

From my practice, I distilled a few strategies that made recursive prompting more effective for me:

1. Pattern Portfolio: Building familiarity with multiple patterns gave me options to try
2. Context Sensitivity: I became more effective when I matched patterns to the current context instead of defaulting to my favorites
3. Metacognitive Integration: Scheduling reflection moments improved quality more than any single move alone
4. Iterative Improvement: Treating each session as practice for the next made me better over time

### Guidelines I Use (and Teach)

If I were guiding someone new, I would share these as starting points, with the clear caveat that they are based on my experience, not universal truth:

#### For Beginners
- Start with simple refinement patterns to get a feel for iteration.
- Master one or two patterns before trying to combine them.
- Use explicit reflection prompts (“Does this solve the problem I set out?”).
- Practice recognizing patterns in areas you know well.

#### For More Advanced Use
- Experiment with sequencing and combining patterns.
- Create your own domain-specific variations.
- Build meta-strategies that string together multiple patterns for multi-stage problems.

#### For Organizations (My Observations)
- Having a shared library of patterns helps teams collaborate more consistently.
- Training that includes metacognitive prompts (not just pattern mechanics) builds stronger prompting habits.
- Tools that scaffold context management and provide pattern reminders could make recursive prompting easier to adopt.

### Closing Reflection

All of these insights come from my personal dataset and my own practice. They form the foundation of how I now teach recursive prompting, but they should be understood as provisional and exploratory. I expect that as others test and refine these approaches, the collective understanding of recursive prompting will grow beyond my individual experience.
