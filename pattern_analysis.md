# Pattern Analysis and Template Generation

## My Pattern Analysis and Template Generation

In this section, I share what I observed in my own recursive prompting conversations. By looking closely at my dataset (441 conversations, 1,980 moves across 13 move types), I noticed recurring patterns that seemed to characterize how I use recursive prompting effectively. These observations are drawn from my own practice and should be treated as exploratory hypotheses and teaching tools, not universal conclusions.

### Pattern Categories I Noticed

When I reviewed my conversations, I saw that most of my prompting sequences could be grouped into five broad categories. These categories help me organize my thinking about when to use different strategies:

#### 1. Exploration Patterns
These patterns focus on discovery and generating alternatives. I used them when I wanted to broaden the space of possible solutions before narrowing in.

**Characteristic Sequence**: Seed → Probe → Compare → Refine  
**Effectiveness (for me)**: High for open-ended problems and creative tasks  
**Frequency in my dataset**: About 23% of the successful conversations I reviewed

#### 2. Refinement Patterns
These are iterative improvement sequences, where I asked the AI to progressively improve or polish a draft.

**Characteristic Sequence**: Initial → Critique → Revise → Validate  
**Effectiveness (for me)**: Strong for optimization and quality improvement  
**Frequency in my dataset**: About 31% of successful conversations

#### 3. Metacognitive Patterns
Self-reflective moves where I paused to check assumptions, goals, or reasoning. These moments often helped me reorient and get unstuck.

**Characteristic Sequence**: Reflect → Question → Verify → Adjust  
**Effectiveness (for me)**: Especially helpful for complex analytical tasks  
**Frequency in my dataset**: About 18% of successful conversations

#### 4. Iterative Development Patterns
Incremental building sequences that felt natural for step-by-step work like software development or structured planning.

**Characteristic Sequence**: Build → Test → Expand → Integrate  
**Effectiveness (for me)**: Very useful for systematic construction tasks  
**Frequency in my dataset**: About 19% of successful conversations

#### 5. Structured Problem-Solving Patterns
Methodical approaches where I applied decomposition or other structured frameworks.

**Characteristic Sequence**: Define → Decompose → Solve → Synthesize  
**Effectiveness (for me)**: Strong for well-defined analytical problems  
**Frequency in my dataset**: About 9% of successful conversations

### From Categories to Templates

From these categories, I formalized 20 recurring patterns distilled into 16 reusable templates (v1) (see Pattern Templates (v1)). These templates capture the core sequences I used most often and package them in a way I can teach to others. Each template includes:

- Move Sequence: The ordered progression of moves I used  
- Context Markers: Clues for when the pattern is most useful  
- Adaptation Notes: How I adjusted the pattern across different kinds of tasks  
- Practice-Based Notes: What I observed about its strengths and limitations in my own sessions  

You can find the full set of templates in Pattern Templates (v1). They are not definitive or universal—they represent what worked for me and what I now share as starting points for others.

### How I Saw Patterns Apply Across My Work

Even though all my data comes from my own practice, I noticed that these patterns seemed to apply across very different types of tasks I worked on:

- **Software development and debugging**  
- **Creative writing and content generation**  
- **Research and analytical problem-solving**  
- **Educational content creation**  
- **Strategic planning and decision-making**  

In each of these contexts, the core patterns held up, but I sometimes needed to adapt vocabulary or adjust constraints to fit the domain. That adaptability is what makes me believe the templates have teaching value beyond my own sessions, even though they require testing by others to validate.

## Analysis Summary

[Visualizations to be added in a future release] The analytical tools I used (frequency distributions, transition analysis, sequence flows) helped illustrate how these patterns emerged from my personal dataset. They served as a way to see how my prompting sequences tended to unfold, not as general laws of human-AI interaction.
