# Recursive Prompting Move Analysis

## My Recursive Prompting Move Analysis

This section documents what I found when I analyzed the 13 types of moves I used across 441 conversations (1,980 moves in total). These observations are based entirely on my own practice, scored with my personal rubric, and should be treated as exploratory and subjective. They helped me understand how I naturally prompt and which moves I might teach to others through reusable templates.

For detailed definitions and examples of each move type, see the [Move Types Reference](move_types_reference.md).

### How Often I Used Each Move

Here’s how my move usage broke down in my dataset:

| Move Type      | Frequency | Percentage |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Probe          | 274       | 13.8%      |
| ScopeTighten   | 267       | 13.5%      |
| ScopeLoosen    | 266       | 13.4%      |
| FormatControl  | 248       | 12.5%      |
| Seed           | 211       | 10.7%      |
| Refine         | 122       | 6.2%       |
| ConstraintsAdd | 102       | 5.2%       |
| RoleShift      | 152       | 7.7%       |
| Recurse        | 148       | 7.5%       |
| Meta           | 70        | 3.5%       |
| Compare        | 67        | 3.4%       |
| Decompose      | 38        | 1.9%       |
| Hypothesis     | 15        | 0.8%       |

I relied most heavily on **probing and scope control**. Less frequent but still valuable were **reflection (Meta), decomposition, and hypothesis moves**, which often gave me breakthroughs when I was stuck.

### Which Moves Felt Most Effective to Me

Based on my scoring system (0–20 scale for relevance, completeness, actionability), I noticed these trends in my own practice:

- **Metacognitive moves (Meta)**: Even though rare, when I used reflection explicitly, it noticeably improved my outcomes.  
- **Decomposition (Decompose)**: Helped me break down complexity and regain traction.  
- **Hypothesis testing (Hypothesis)**: Small in sample size but powerful when applied—especially in analytical or research-style problems.  
- **Scope control (Tighten/Loosen)**: Alternating between narrowing and widening scope was one of my most common habits and often improved clarity.  

These are not statistical proofs—they are the patterns I found useful for myself.

### How My Moves Connected Into Sequences

I also looked at how one move flowed into the next. Some of the strongest recurring transitions in my sessions were:

- **Probe → Refine**: Start broad, then polish a chosen path.  
- **Seed → Probe**: Establish context, then explore alternatives.  
- **Meta → Decompose**: Reflect first, then break the problem into pieces.  
- **ScopeTighten ↔ ScopeLoosen**: A back-and-forth rhythm of zooming in and out.  

For me, these transitions represent my natural “prompting habits.” They later became the backbone of my reusable pattern templates (v1).

### How This Ties Into My Template Library

The insights from my move analysis directly informed the 20 recurring patterns distilled into 16 reusable templates (v1) (see Pattern Templates (v1)). For example:

- The Probe → Refine transition became part of my "Probe → ScopeTighten → Refine" template  
- The Meta → Decompose pairing shows up in "Meta → Decompose → Seed"  
- The ScopeTighten ↔ ScopeLoosen alternation inspired "ScopeTighten → ScopeLoosen → Recurse"  

This shows how raw move-level habits turned into teachable structures.

### Analysis Tools

[Visualizations to be added in a future release] I used frequency analysis, transition analysis, and sequence analysis to better understand how I prompt. These analytical tools were most valuable to me as a reflective method—they let me see my own habits. They do not represent laws of prompting; they represent my personal style.

**Summary of My Move-Level Observations:**

- My most frequent moves were **Probe, ScopeTighten, ScopeLoosen, and FormatControl**.  
- **Reflection, decomposition, and hypothesis testing** were less common but often disproportionately helpful.  
- Certain transitions became recurring habits, which I later codified into reusable templates.  
- These insights formed the foundation for my **pattern analysis** and **template library (v1)**, which I now use as teaching tools for recursive prompting.
