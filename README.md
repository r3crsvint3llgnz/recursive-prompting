# Recursive Prompting: A Framework for Intent Stabilization in LLMs

Recursive Prompting is a systematic methodology for the mechanical steering of Large Language Models (LLMs). This project documents the formalization of "Prompt Control"—a discipline that replaces the trial-and-error heuristics of standard prompting with a rigorous, multi-stage interactional framework. By treating the LLM as an engine of probability that must be constrained and calibrated, this system facilitates high-fidelity outcome generation in complex reasoning environments.

### Core Documentation

The framework is supported by a comprehensive technical corpus outlining the methodology, taxonomy, and empirical observations derived from a single-practitioner exploratory study (n=1). 

*   **[Manifesto: The Architecture of Reasoning](Manifesto.md)**: An architectural premise defining the conceptual foundations of cognitive scaffolding and intent stabilization.
*   **[Abstract & Research Summary](abstract.md)**: A high-level overview of the 441 interaction threads and 1,980 steering operations analyzed in this corpus.
*   **[Complete Whitepaper](complete_whitepaper.md)**: A unified technical document synthesizing the methodology, results, and failure mode taxonomy of the framework.
*   **[Steering Moves Reference](move_types_reference.md)**: A functional taxonomy of the 13 discrete operations used for model state calibration.
*   **[Pattern Templates (v1)](pattern_templates_v1.md)**: A library of 16 validated sequence patterns for predictable task execution.

### Empirical Context

Analysis of 441 discrete threads reveals a consistent correlation between recursive steering and the mitigation of stochastic drift. Observed performance deltas include a 34% subjective improvement in outcome quality and a significant increase in signal density across multiple domains—most notably technical architecture and strategic synthesis. This repository serves as a technical foundation for the transition from passive AI adoption to active systems steering; it provides the structural blueprints necessary for the development of reproducible, high-signal conversational states.
