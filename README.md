# Recursive Prompting: An Exploratory Self-Study

**Author:** Seth Robins (Recursive Intelligence)

**Version:** 1.0  

## Overview

This whitepaper documents an exploratory, single-practitioner analysis (n=1) of **recursive prompting** based on 441 of my own conversation threads comprising 1,980 prompting moves across 13 move types. Through this self-analysis, I identified 20 recurring sequence patterns and formalized 16 reusable templates (v1) across five categories—**Exploration**, **Refinement**, **Metacognitive**, **Iterative Development**, and **Structured Problem-Solving**.

My goal in this project was not to prove general effectiveness, but to understand my own prompting techniques well enough to teach them to others. The numbers and structures presented here come from patterns I observed in my own sessions with ChatGPT. They should be treated as **hypotheses and teaching tools**, not definitive research findings.

## Abstract

When I used metacognitive reflection, systematic decomposition, and iterative refinement moves, I achieved better outcomes. My conversations alternated between scope-tightening and exploratory phases, with periodic validation loops. The resulting Pattern Templates (v1) capture practical templates I found useful in personal productivity, business decision-making, and education.

**Key Findings:**
- ~34% subjective improvement in outcomes using recursive prompting vs. single-shot prompting
- 20 recurring sequence patterns identified across 441 conversations
- 16 reusable templates formalized across 5 categories
- Effectiveness depends on strategic move selection, adaptive sequencing, and metacognitive awareness

**Limitations:** This is an n=1 exploratory self-study with subjective effectiveness scoring and self-classification of moves. All findings reflect my personal experience and require validation through future multi-user controlled studies.
