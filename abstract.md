# Abstract

This white paper documents an exploratory, single-practitioner analysis (n=1) of recursive prompting based on 441 of my own conversation threads comprising 1,980 prompting moves across 13 move types. Through this self-analysis, I identified 20 recurring patterns distilled into 16 reusable templates (v1) across five categories: Exploration, Refinement, Metacognitive, Iterative Development, and Structured Problem-Solving.

My goal was not to prove general effectiveness, but to understand my own prompting techniques well enough to teach them to others. The numbers and structures presented here come from patterns I observed in my own ChatGPT sessions. They should be treated as hypotheses and teaching tools, not definitive research findings.

Key observations from my dataset include:
- When I used metacognitive reflection, systematic decomposition, and iterative refinement moves, I achieved better outcomes
- My conversations alternated between scope-tightening and exploratory phases, with periodic validation loops
- The resulting Pattern Templates (v1) capture practical templates I found useful in personal productivity, business decision-making, and education

**Limitations:** This is an n=1 exploratory self-study with subjective effectiveness scoring (~34%) and self-classification of moves. All findings reflect my personal experience and require validation through future multi-user controlled studies.

This work provides a foundation for sharing my approach to recursive prompting and offers starting points for others to experiment with and adapt to their own workflows.
