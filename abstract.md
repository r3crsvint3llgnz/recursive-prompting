# Abstract

The efficacy of large language model (LLM) steering remains largely anecdotal; this study provides a formal, single-practitioner analysis (n=1) of **Recursive Prompting** as a systematic framework for intent preservation. Investigation of 441 discrete interaction threads—comprising 1,980 individual steering operations—facilitated the identification of 20 recurring sequence patterns. These sequences were subsequently distilled into 16 validated templates across five functional domains: exploratory divergence, iterative refinement, metacognitive regulation, incremental development, and structured analytical decomposition.

Data derivation focused on the mechanical correlation between specific prompt architectures and output reliability. While conventional prompting strategies often result in stochastic drift, the implementation of objective steering moves demonstrates a marked stabilization of model coherence. Key observations indicate that the prioritization of metacognitive reflection and systematic decomposition significantly mitigates the typical performance decay associated with high-complexity tasks. This analysis characterizes the "Control Loop" not as an optional addition, but as the fundamental variable in signal maintenance.

Limitations inherent to single-user exploratory research apply. The subjective nature of the performance metrics necessitates caution; subsequent multi-user controlled trials are required to validate the generalizability of these findings. This work establishes a technical foundation for the formalization of recursive prompting as a discipline of cognitive steering.
