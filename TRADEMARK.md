# Trademark Guidelines: Protecting the Mechanism

**Recursive Prompting™** and **Recursive Intelligence™** represent a specific architecture of cognitive steering developed by Seth Robins. These guidelines ensure that the system's integrity and provenance are maintained as it is adopted by the broader community.

## 1. Core Trademarks

*   **Recursive Prompting™**: The overarching methodology of iterative, move-based LLM steering.
*   **Recursive Intelligence™**: The research and development entity behind the methodology.

## 2. Permitted Use (The Loop is Open)

I believe the mechanism should be accessible. You are encouraged to:
*   **Implement**: Use the transitions and [Pattern Templates](pattern_templates_v1.md) in your personal and commercial workflows.
*   **Teach**: Reference the methodology in educational materials, workshops, and coaching.
*   **Analyze**: Conduct research, write commentary, and build derivatives based on these findings.

## 3. Required Attribution

Precision requires source integrity. When referencing the methodology, the following attribution is required:
> *Recursive Prompting™ methodology developed by Seth Robins (Recursive Intelligence).*

## 4. Restrictions (The Constraints)

To prevent market confusion and "magic prompt" dilution, the following uses are restricted:
*   **Product Branding**: You may not name your software, company, or service "Recursive Prompting" or "Recursive Intelligence" without explicit written permission.
*   **Derivative Branding**: You may not create confusingly similar marks (e.g., "Recursive Prompting Pro", "Recursive Intelligence AI").
*   **Misleading Provenance**: You may not claim authorship or origin of the core taxonomy or patterns.

## 5. Licensing & Permissions

The **analytical content** of this repository is licensed under **[CC BY-SA 4.0](LICENSE.md)**. The trademark protects the **identity and reputation** of the system.
