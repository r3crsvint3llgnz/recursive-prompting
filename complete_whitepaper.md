## Abstract

This whitepaper documents an exploratory, single-practitioner analysis (n=1) of **Recursive Prompting** based on 441 of my own conversation threads comprising 1,980 individual **Steering Moves**. 

Recursive Prompting is a system of **Cognitive Scaffolding** designed to shift the workload from "guessing" to "steering." Through this self-analysis, I identified 20 recurring sequence patterns distilled into 16 reusable templates (v1). The core finding is that quality is not a property of the model, but a function of the control loop.

## 1. Introduction: The Control Problem

The problem with modern AI interaction is drift. We approach LLMs with intent, but we often leave with a "good enough" approximation. **Recursive Prompting** treates the LLM not as a source of truth, but as an engine of probability that must be constrained and steered through a mechanical loop.

This study explores the atomic units of that loop: the 13 **Core Steering Moves** and the stable **Patterns** that produce repeatable quality.

## 2. Methodology: Extracting the Mechanism

I do not believe in magic prompts. I believe in mechanical loops. To understand why some interactions succeed while others drift into noise, I stripped 441 of my own interaction threads down to their mechanical skeletons.

**The Extraction Process:**
1.  **Segmentation**: Conversations sliced into discrete, goal-oriented threads.
2.  **Structural Stripping**: Normalization to reveal the underlying mechanical sequence.
3.  **Persistence Audit**: Verification of sequence completeness.

I measured output using a 20-point mechanical rubric (Relevance, Completeness, Actionability, and Signal Density). Reliability is not a feeling; it is a measurable state.

## 3. Steering Moves: The Atoms of Control

The system is built on 13 discrete actions. These are the atomic units of the **Prompt Control** loop.

*   **[Probe](move_types_reference.md#1-probe)**: Divergence. Generating the solution space.
*   **[ScopeTighten](move_types_reference.md#2-scopetighten)**: Convergence. Making ruthless decisions.
*   **[Meta](move_types_reference.md#10-meta)**: Metacognition. Fixing the map before driving.
*   *Full definitions available in the [Steering Moves Reference](move_types_reference.md).*

## 4. Pattern Analysis: The Architecture of Stability

Individual moves are atoms. Patterns are molecules. I identified five primary categories of interaction architecture—defensive barriers built against drift.

### Scaffolding Categories:
1.  **Exploration Scaffolds**: Seed → Probe → Compare.
2.  **Refinement Scaffolds**: Initial → Critique → Revise.
3.  **Metacognitive Scaffolds**: Reflect → Question → Adjust.
4.  **Development Scaffolds**: Build → Test → Expand.
5.  **Problem-Solving Scaffolds**: Define → Decompose → Solve.

## 5. Results: The Data of Steering

Performance is not an opinion. In my n=1 analysis, I measured how **Prompt Control** changes the texture of output.

### Key Performance Deltas:
*   **Subjective Outcome Improvement**: ~34% (compared to single-shot prompting).
*   **Signal Density**: ~42% increase in usable content.
*   **Structural Integrity**: ~31% higher rate of hitting original objectives.

## 6. Effectiveness & Failure Modes

Effective control is not binary. Success depends on recognizing failure modes and applying the correct remedy.

*   **Failure: Premature Convergence**: Remedy with a [Probe](move_types_reference.md#1-probe) move.
*   **Failure: Metacognitive Neglect**: Remedy with a [Meta](move_types_reference.md#10-meta) move.
*   **Failure: Context Drift**: Remedy with [Decompose](move_types_reference.md#12-decompose).

## 7. Discussion: Scaffolding the Future

The data suggests that intelligence, in this context, is an emergent property of the scaffold. The LLM provides the computational breadth; the practitioner provides the steering torque. We need interfaces that respect this mechanism: visible scaffolding, context management, and pattern libraries.

---

## 8. Conclusion: Stop Hoping, Start Steering.

Precision is not an accident. It is an architecture. Studying these moves made me a more competent prompter. Documenting the patterns forced my reasoning to be visible.

This is the blueprint. Build it. Test it. Steering is a discipline of the mind.
