# Introduction

## Introduction

This white paper represents my exploratory self-study of **recursive prompting**—a methodology I developed and refined through my own interactions with ChatGPT. Rather than a generalizable or controlled research project, this is a reflection and analysis of my personal practice (441 conversations, 1,980 moves across 13 move types) with the goal of making my prompting techniques more understandable, teachable, and adaptable for others.

### Why I Did This Study

I created Recursive Prompting because I often found single-shot prompting insufficient for complex tasks. By experimenting with iterative refinement, clarification, and expansion, I began to notice patterns in how I prompted. These patterns seemed to help me get better outcomes. I wanted to analyze these patterns systematically—not to prove their universal effectiveness, but to understand my own habits well enough that I could share them as templates and teaching tools.

Recursive prompting, for me, mirrors human cognitive strategies such as reflective thinking, hypothesis testing, and incremental problem-solving. By documenting how I use these strategies, I can provide examples that others may try, adapt, or test in their own workflows.

### What I Hoped to Learn

Through this self-study, my aims were to:

1. **Characterize My Prompting Moves**: Identify and categorize the types of moves I used most often in my conversations.
2. **See How They Worked for Me**: Document the kinds of responses different moves tended to produce in my sessions.
3. **Distill Patterns into Templates**: Formalize recurring move sequences into reusable templates (20 observed patterns distilled into 16 reusable templates (v1)).
4. **Generate Hypotheses for Others to Test**: Share my findings as hypotheses and teaching material that others can validate or adapt in their own practice.

### What This Work Contributes

This is not a generalizable study. It is an **exploratory, single-practitioner analysis (n=1)**. Its value lies in what it can offer as a foundation for practice and teaching:

- A personal taxonomy of recursive prompting moves and how I used them
- Observed effectiveness patterns from my own sessions (subjective, not objective)
- A set of 16 reusable templates (v1) based on the 20 patterns I noticed
- Reflections on success factors, failure modes, and practical strategies that worked for me

### How I Hope Others Will Use This

I share this work so others can:

- Experiment with the templates I found useful
- Reflect on their own prompting habits in comparison to mine
- Adapt and expand on these ideas in their own domains
- Develop controlled studies to validate or refine the patterns

**Important Limitation:** This paper documents my practice alone. All effectiveness measures come from my personal scoring rubric and judgment. These findings should be treated as exploratory, subjective, and hypothesis-generating—not as proof of effectiveness or generalizable conclusions.
