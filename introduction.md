# Introduction: The Control Problem

Stochastic decay—the progressive divergence between initial operator intent and eventual model output—remains the primary barrier to high-fidelity Large Language Model (LLM) utilization. Conventional "prompt engineering" operates largely through lexical trial and error; users employ ritualized text strings in the hope of eliciting favorable probabilistic distributions. This approach lacks the structural rigor necessary for the stabilization of complex conversational states. 

Recursive Prompting addresses this deficit through the implementation of **Cognitive Scaffolding**. By treating the LLM as a multi-stage reasoning engine rather than a single-shot retrieval system, this methodology establishes a mechanical feedback loop for the continuous calibration of model state. The objective of this study is the formalization of this loop into its constituent steering operations and sequence patterns.

This analysis prioritizes three primary areas of investigation: the categorization of 13 Steering Moves into a functional taxonomy; the identification of stable sequence patterns for repeatable outcome generation; and the role of metacognitive regulation—the "pause"—in the mitigation of intent drift. This is a practitioner’s record of system optimization. The findings presented here are intended to serve as a technical blueprint for operators seeking to replace stochastic hope with mechanical steering. Success in this domain is not an accident of phrasing; it is a consequence of architectural precision.
