# Context and Further Reading

## Note on References

This self-study is based entirely on my own practice and analysis of my personal prompting data (n=1). I did not draw from existing research or white papers in generating the findings presented here.
The works listed below are provided as **context and further reading** for those who wish to situate recursive prompting alongside broader prompting research and practitioner resources.
They did not inform my results directly, but they highlight directions I see as relevant for future exploration, validation, and expansion.

## How I Plan to Use These Works

While none of these informed my self-study directly, I see them as resources for situating recursive prompting in a larger conversation.
In future iterations, especially as I expand beyond my own dataset into multi-user controlled studies, I expect to connect my analysis with the frameworks and techniques described in these works.
