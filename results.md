# Results: The Data of Steering

Performance is not an opinion. It is a measurement of the system’s ability to hit the target.

In this n=1 analysis of 441 threads, I measured how **Prompt Control** changes the texture of the output. 

## Observed Effectiveness

By applying the mechanical rubric (Relevance, Completeness, Actionability), I observed a **~34% subjective improvement** in outcomes compared to unmanaged, single-shot prompting.

This is the key finding: Quality is a function of the control loop.

### System Performance Deltas
In my practitioner logs, the following indicators shifted when Recursive Prompting was applied:

*   **Signal Density**: ~42% increase in usable content. Less fluff. More marrow.
*   **Structural Integrity**: ~31% higher rate of hitting the original objective. 
*   **Solution Fit**: ~28% improvement in how well the answer addressed the specific problem constraints.

## The High-Impact Moves

Not all moves are created equal. In the analysis of 1,980 moves, three operations emerged as the heavy lifters of cognitive scaffolding:

1.  **Metacognition ([Meta](move_types_reference.md#10-meta))**: The pause that fixes the question before fixing the answer.
2.  **Structural Breakdown ([Decompose](move_types_reference.md#12-decompose))**: Turning a massive, fuzzy goal into a series of predictable actions.
3.  **Iteration ([Refine](move_types_reference.md#6-refine))**: The deliberate polish that removes the generic "average" of a first-shot model output.

### Rhythmic Dynamics

The most successful threads weren't linear. They were rhythmic.
They alternated between **Exploration** ([Probe](move_types_reference.md#1-probe)) and **Execution** ([ScopeTighten](move_types_reference.md#2-scopetighten)). They used **Validation Loops** to check the map before driving.

## Domain-Specific Yields

*   **Technical Architecture**: Leaned heavily on [Decompose](move_types_reference.md#12-decompose) and [Hypothesis](move_types_reference.md#13-hypothesis).
*   **Strategic Planning**: Relied on [RoleShift](move_types_reference.md#8-roleshift) and [Probe](move_types_reference.md#1-probe) to reveal blind spots.
*   **Knowledge Synthesis**: Optimized through [Refine](move_types_reference.md#6-refine) and [Meta](move_types_reference.md#10-meta).
