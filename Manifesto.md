# Manifesto: The Architecture of Reasoning

This framework rejects the colloquial conceptualization of "prompt engineering" as a collection of lexical heuristics. It prioritizes the rigorous implementation of **Prompt Control**—a discipline centered on the mechanical stabilization of machine-human reasoning trajectories. **Recursive Prompting** provides the necessary **Cognitive Scaffolding** to mitigate the stochastic decay typical of complex interactional states; it facilitates the decomposition of abstract intent into discrete, inspectable, and steerable operations.

The development of this methodology originated from a fundamental requirement for informational fidelity. In high-complexity reasoning environments, implicit context and unmanaged probabilistic drift frequently result in the degradation of output coherence. By enforcing an explicit, multi-stage control loop, the operator ensures the visibility of the underlying reasoning mechanism. This approach transforms the Large Language Model (LLM) from a black-box oracle into a steerable engine of probability—one where performance is a direct consequence of structural precision rather than ritualized text.

The foundations of Recursive Prompting rest on four primary pillars of intent stabilization: the anchoring of interactional state through objective "Seed" moves; the utilization of constraint-driven "torque" to elicit narrow probabilistic distributions; the mitigation of cognitive overload through strategic scope-tightening; and the integration of metacognitive pauses for continuous calibration. This framework demands that the practitioner assume responsibility for the architectural integrity of the reasoning process. Success is not a property of the model’s linguistic fluency; it is a consequence of the operator’s structural scaffolding.
