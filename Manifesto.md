## The Architect's View

I am not interested in "prompt engineering" as a collection of magic words. I am interested in the discipline of **Prompt Control**.

**Recursive Prompting** is a system for **Cognitive Scaffolding**. It shifts the workload from "guessing" to "steering." It breaks the cognitive blur of a complex task into discrete, mechanical operations—**Steering Moves**—that you can execute, inspect, and correct.

I developed this system because I had to. As an autistic practitioner, I cannot rely on implicit context. I need reasoning to be visible. I need the mechanism to be exposed. When I forced my own LLM interactions into explicit steps, my error rate dropped, and the texture of the output changed. It became solid.

## The Four Foundations of Recursive Prompting

To steer a model, you must stop treating it like a chatbot and start treating it like a system of gears.

### 1. Intent is the Signal
The model only knows what you tell it. If your intent is fuzzy, the output is noise. In Recursive Prompting, intent is not just "what I want" but "how I will measure success." We anchor every interaction with a **Seed** move to establish the signal's ground truth.

### 2. Constraints are the Torque
Authenticity and precision are not the results of freedom; they are the results of friction. By adding **Constraints**, we force the engine of probability into narrower paths. A model that can do anything will do the average of everything. A model that is constrained is forced to be precise.

### 3. Subtraction as a Feature
The most powerful tool in the architect's kit is **ScopeTightening**. Most failures occur because the context has become too heavy. We do not solve complex problems by adding more text; we solve them by stripping away the irrelevant until only the mechanism remains.

### 4. Metacognition is the Lever
Human intelligence is the ability to think about thinking. **Steering Moves** like **Meta** and **Reflect** are the pauses where we check the map before we drive. Without a metacognitive layer, you are just reacting to the model. With it, you are steering it.

## The Core Scaffolding

This repository provides the blueprints for building your own control loops:

*   **[Steering Moves](move_types_reference.md)**: The atomic units of control.
*   **[Pattern Templates](pattern_templates_v1.md)**: The stable architectures of interaction.
*   **[n=1 Study](complete_whitepaper.md)**: The data-driven analysis of the system's effectiveness.

## The Practitioner's Promise

Recursive Prompting does not make the work easier. It makes the work **visible**. It demands that you take responsibility for the reasoning process. 

**Stop hoping for a better response. Build a better scaffold.**
