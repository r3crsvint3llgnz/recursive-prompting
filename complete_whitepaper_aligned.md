# Recursive Prompting Methodology: A Practitioner’s Analysis of Iterative Problem-Solving Techniques

## Abstract

**IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS: This is an exploratory single-practitioner study (n=1 user) that analyzes only my personal conversation patterns. Results may not generalize to other users or contexts.**

This white paper presents my exploratory analysis of my own Recursive Prompting methodology—an approach to iterative problem-solving that I developed through interactions with ChatGPT. Through analysis of **441** of my conversations containing **1,980** distinct moves across **13 move types**, I identify **20 recurring patterns** distilled into **16 reusable templates (v1)** that characterize my personal prompting behavior. I propose hypotheses about what may contribute to effective recursive prompting. This study is intended to generate hypotheses for future controlled research rather than establish proven effectiveness.

**Keywords:** Recursive Prompting, Conversational AI, Iterative Problem-Solving, Move Analysis, Pattern Recognition, Personal Methodology, Exploratory Study

## Data Provenance & Coverage

- Conversations dataset → 441 total analyzed  
- Moves dataset → 1,980 moves across 13 types  
- Patterns analysis → 20 patterns observed  
- Template library (v1) → 16 reusable templates (v1)
- Progression analysis → 370 conversations with complete metrics  

This ensures reviewers see the source of each number and why the progression table is smaller.
